    "born_where": "Midland, Texas",
    "born_story": "I was born on June 4, 1954, in Midland, Texas, at Annie’s house.",
    "which one in texas or california": "I experienced a little of both. I was born in Midland, Texas, and we lived in Annie’s house—though I can’t recall the street name, I think it was 801 East Texas. We then moved to Denver with Aunt Lil. My mama moved to Denver, and we stayed with Aunt Lil for a while before returning to Midland, where I started kindergarten. We also stayed with Mama Liddy in Malone, Texas, for a time because Big Mama watched Aunt Lil’s two boys while she worked. Annie, Mama Liddy, and Aunt Lil were all Big Mama Mamie Sorrell’s children. After returning to Midland, I went to kindergarten, then first and second grade there, as well as preschool. In third grade, we moved to California with Aunt Lil, and I stayed there for third and fourth grade. Big Mama came back to Midland when I was in fifth grade, and after finishing that year, I decided to stay with my mama, Esther Pearl, in Denver for sixth grade. I didn’t like it because the lifestyle there wasn’t what I was used to. Just before graduation, I called Big Mama to come get me. She did, and we went back to Los Angeles, where I completed seventh and eighth grade and stayed until I became pregnant with Jade.",
    "what are some of your earliest childhood memories good and or bad": "Living with Big Mama, I remember being surrounded by all my aunts—Aunt Helen, Aunt Lillie, Raina, Annie—and Big Mama’s son, Ernest, whom they called Big Brother. I didn’t like him because he was a bully who would pull my hair hard. I also recall seeing my cousins with their parents and feeling the absence of my own. Big Mama told me my mama had given me to a woman in a hotel, and Big Mama went and got me back while I was still an infant. I called Big Mama “Mama,” and she explained she was my grandmother, but she was raising me. Before moving to California, she would walk me to school, which was just a couple of blocks from Annie’s house. When we came to LA, I grew close to Spooky like a brother, but I always felt I didn’t truly fit in with my aunts’ children. That made me determined that when I had kids, they would always know their mother and father.",
    "can you tell me your biological mother and father s name": "My mother’s name was Esther Pearl Sorrows, and my father’s name was Hugo Henderson. I never met my father in person, though I spoke to him once on the phone when I was around seven or eight. He said he was coming to see me, but he never arrived—he was said to be sick. He once sent me a porcelain doll that I cherished until a little girl Big Mama cared for broke it. When I was eight, Aunt Lil said she would take me to meet him in Bakersfield, but he died before we could go. I never knew my siblings on his side, though I was told I was the youngest on his side and the oldest on my mother’s. My mother was in her early twenties when she had me, and my father was in his fifties. I had one sister from his side, Sandra, who visited me once when I was young. On my mother’s side, my siblings were Richard Jr. (RB), Gretchen (a twin whose sister died at birth), Larry, and Lanetta. I was closest to Richard during the year I lived with them in Denver. RV passed away from epilepsy, and Gretchen has also passed. My mother had six children total—three boys and three girls—and four of us are still living today.",
    "when big mama started raising you how old was she": "When I was six years old, Big Mama told me she was 66, and I never forgot that. That’s how I always knew her age. By that time, she was retired. Before I was born, she used to clean houses, and that’s also what Annie did. Aunt Lil—before becoming a beautician—did other work I don’t know much about, but once she was a beautician, that became her main job. Big Mama’s own mother had been a slave, but Big Mama herself wasn’t born into slavery.",
    "when you were a kid what chores or responsibilities did you have": "I didn’t have chores. Big Mama did everything for me. I didn’t have to clean the kitchen, mop, or do laundry. If I helped, it was because I wanted to or because she wasn’t feeling well. She would wake up early, have my breakfast ready before school, and my dinner ready when I came home. My clothes were always washed and ironed. I was just a kid who got to be outside and enjoy childhood—same for Spooky. Neither of us had chores.",
    "did your family have any traditions that meant a lot to you": "No, we didn’t have family reunions or traditions like that. I do remember Big Mama’s daughters visiting every summer, and during those times I often felt like I was second. Her time and attention would go to them and their kids, which made sense because she hadn’t seen them in a year. I would usually keep to myself. Spooky was always her number one—whatever Spooky wanted, he got. Big Mama never neglected me, but I wasn’t treated like her daughter.",
    "what kind of food did your family cook the most any favorite dishes from your childhood": "Big Mama cooked soul food—like most Black families at the time. She made a lot of tea cakes and, if I asked before school, she’d have an egg pie (egg custard) waiting for me when I got home. She also baked homemade bread, and Tony would try to eat a whole loaf. Tony and I have been friends since I was eight and she was seven, and we’ve been close ever since.",
    "did you ever have a pet as a kid": "Yes—our German Shepherd named Bell. We loved her, and she loved us. Later, Aunt Lil got Pierre, a little poodle. He was Aunt Lil’s dog and had a habit of pretending to be hurt so people would fuss over him. Sometimes he’d limp, and then we’d catch him walking just fine. We used to say, “Look, Mama—he’s not limping now!”",
    "was there a moment that defined who you were or the direction you took in life": "None that I can think of right now. I just went to school, stayed out of trouble, and didn’t do drugs. Spooky, Tony, and their friends smoked weed, and a few tried pills like Red Devils. Seeing how they acted made me say, “If it does that to them, it’ll do that to me—I’m not taking that mess.” I didn’t start smoking weed until I got with your dad, and that’s only because he said I didn’t do anything. I never drank. I smoked for a little while, but we both quit.",
    "if you could relive a childhood day which would it be and why": "I don’t know, Ty—I didn’t have a bad childhood. Big Mama made sure I was taken care of. If she thought something was dangerous, she didn’t allow me near it. I had cousins she kept me away from, like David Lee—she’d say, “If you see him, you come on back in this house,” and I couldn’t understand because he was married to my aunt. My grandmother raised me well, and I’m grateful. Only God knows what would’ve happened if I’d stayed with my mama—my brother went through a lot with her, things I was spared from.\n   Me and Spooky thought we were rich—Uncle Frank gave us money, bought us bikes, and even a piano when Spooky was sick because he could have “anything he wanted.” Big Mama and Aunt Lil kept me clothed, fed, and loved. My childhood was actually better than what I could give my kids later, because me and your dad had to start over several times. But I hope we were still good parents.",
    "who was your best friend as a teenager and what did you do together": "I had several best friends in my teenage years. Tony was one, but every time we got together, I got in trouble—Tony was something else. I was also close with Terry McCoy, Jae’s godmother. She lived across the tracks, and we did a lot together. Deborah, who lived across the street, was another friend; she was two years older than me, and I’d spend time at her house. Then there was Kathy from next door—we were in the Girl Scouts together. Her mom was our troop leader. When her family moved, we drifted apart until years later when Spooky passed away.",
    "in high school what was your favorite subject and least favorite any favorite teacher": "My favorite subject was Marine Biology. My least favorite was English—I just wasn’t good at it. My Marine Biology teacher was a young white man who really understood and worked with the kids. In English, I had Miss Washington—she was cute, so all the boys liked her, but she was also down-to-earth and talked to us girls about life, relationships, and what to watch out for. She was real with us, and I respected that.",
    "okay what was your style like as a teenager did you follow trends or set your own": "I guess we followed trends. Big Mama was one. I didn't go shopping — Big Mama did all my shopping, and she had good taste.",
    "who or what inspired you the most in your teenage years": "As a teenager, who inspired me the most? I'd have to say Miss Allen — Kathy's mom. I admired her. I watched her with her children, Mister Allen (her husband), and they lived right next door to Jane Lill, across from Miss Sally. I admired her and used to think, “When I grow up, that’s the kind of mama I want to be,” because I admired how she raised her kids.",
    "any favorite singers or bands": "I like all music. When the Jackson Five came out and just all music in general, I liked it all — and I still do. I can’t remember one specifically.",
    "did you have a first job what was it like": "Babysitting. I loved kids, so I would babysit the kids on the block because Tony didn’t like kids. She said, “You babysit,” so I would babysit. I can remember babysitting because I wanted to give Big Mama something special for Mother’s Day. She would talk about how hot the back house would be, and I wanted to get her a fan. So I babysat the boys first — they used to live right next door where we stayed on Fifth Avenue. Then the next year they moved, and I started babysitting the ones next door to her. She had two or three girls, and I babysat them. Later, when Deborah had her baby, I was the only one on the block that would do anything with her, because back then people judged you if you had a kid young. But I didn’t have a problem with it. I always had kids around me — if kids were involved, I was there.",
    "what was one lesson you learned as a teenager that may still stick with you today": "Not to follow people.",
    "how did you meet dad what was your first impression of him": "I met Ricky when I stayed on 65th in Vermont. His sister Linda stayed in the apartment next to Big Mama (it used to be in Lee’s apartment). I met him through her and saw her brothers — Clint, Charles, and then Ricky. Charles had tried to talk to me, but I didn’t want to because he drank too much. I didn’t like Clint because he had a bad attitude. I said, “If I talk to any of your brothers, it would be Ricky.” Linda told Ricky, and Ricky took me and Jade to the drive-in because he thought I had more kids. He had been told, “She’s got all them kids,” but Linda corrected him — “None of them are hers, she just braids their hair. She only has one — the little boy that’s always up here with me.” I was pregnant with Mika then. Me and Ricky went out, and we’ve been together ever since.",
    "i know you didn't have a traditional wedding but what was the day like when you guys did get married": "It was beautiful. It was me, Ricky, Aunt Lil, and Uncle Frank — they were our witnesses. We didn’t have a formal reception, but Uncle Frank and Aunt Lil gave us a small reception party. It was combined with Lorraine’s granddaughter’s birthday, so we celebrated together at Uncle Frank’s club. We never went on a honeymoon, but we were happy",
    "what's one of your favorite memories of you and dad together": "Our anniversary — I can’t remember which one — when he was at the casino and got us a room. I went in and changed into a teddy, and when I came out, he just grabbed me, hugged me, and picked me up. He made me feel so beautiful. I have many memories, but that one really stuck with me. I think about it a lot",
    "was there anything unique or special about your relationship that people might not know": "There was probably a lot because we didn’t share our private life with anyone. Early in our marriage, life was good. When we first got together, Ricky worked for Bethlehem Steel, and I stayed home at first, then got a job at the Red Cross. We were both working and doing well. The first five years had some ups and downs — his mom made him feel stuck, so he left once for my birthday and went to Oakland. My friend’s boyfriend answered my phone while Ricky was away, and Ricky thought someone was trying to get close to me. He came back immediately, and we’ve been together ever since. For a long time, his mom and I didn’t get along — not until after Big Mama passed. Something changed in her after that. She didn’t like that I chose my kids over drugs, but I stood my ground. My kids were always more important to me than that lifestyle.",
    "what was it like becoming a mother for the first time": "It was beautiful. I wanted to be a mom because I was truly in love with Jay’s dad — he was my first boyfriend, my first love — and there was nothing I wouldn’t do for him. That relationship didn’t work out because we were young, but I was okay with that. I enjoyed being a mama. Then Ricky and I got together when Jay was two, and we were together two years before you came along.",
    "how did you choose my name": "Honestly, Ty, I don’t remember exactly. Tony told me I had a friend with that name, but I don’t recall who she was. I just knew I liked the name, so I named you Tyease Myron Butler. When you were born — on Craig’s birthday, Ricky’s baby brother — Craig said, “He’s born on my birthday, he’s gotta have something from me.” So I added Jerome, which is Craig’s middle name. You and Jay both have two middle names; Asia only has one.",
    "how would you describe me as a little boy": "When you were first born, you were very sickly. We didn’t know if the Lord would let us keep you. But when you turned eight months old, you just blossomed. You were fine — mischievous, into everything, smart, and very cute. You reminded me of Kobe. Jay was your big brother and refused to touch you — “I can’t hit my brother.” You had a charm about you that made people love you. One of my girlfriends, who didn’t work, would watch you while I was at work. She once brought you up to my job and told me not to say anything — she wanted people to think you were hers — but the second you saw me, you yelled, “Mommy!”",
    "what is a funny or unexpected thing i did as a child that you ll never forget": "There are several. One time, when I was pregnant with Asia, you and Ricky were waiting in the car while I was in the doctor’s office. Ricky pointed to a woman and told you, “That’s my girlfriend — don’t tell your mama.” You immediately rolled the window down and yelled, “You my dad’s girlfriend!” Another time, at Ferguson’s, you were staring at a beautiful woman in line. I told you to stop staring, and you said, “But she’s beautiful.” With Auntie Robin, you liked to sit next to her and rub her stockings because she was always dressed up with nails done. At Fuji’s funeral, you were about three or four and walked up to his girlfriend while she was washing dishes, chanting “Gucci Gucci Gucci,” and stuck your hand in her clothes — she laughed and said, “Who is this boy?”",
    "what was the most challenging part about raising me": "You weren’t my challenging one — Jay was. We lived in a gang neighborhood and he gave me plenty of worry during his teenage years. With you, I never feared you’d join a gang. You were more like me — you bloomed late. My hardest time with you was when you decided you didn’t want to live with me anymore because you were tired of living in poverty. You went to live with Tony, got a job at Six Flags, and did well. But when you got sick, you came back home and I took care of you. I still remember when you bought me a CD player for my birthday with one of your first paychecks — I still have it, along with the camera you gave me. You were always inquisitive, taking things apart to see how they worked, and you always put them back together in working order.",
    "if you could go back and give your younger self advice what would you say": "Stay in school, go to college, and prepare yourself for life so you can be a better parent — physically, mentally, and financially. I didn’t do that. My whole goal was just being a parent.",
    "what are you most proud of in your life so far": "My children.",
    "what was the hardest decision you ever made": "Choosing to live a healthy life and make changes that would allow me to keep caring for my family.",
    "what was one of the happiest moments of your life": "Becoming a grandmother — first Rajani, then JJ, and later TJ and Kobe. Now I’m a great-grandmother too.",
    "have you ever had a moment when you felt god s presence very strongly": "Yes, more than once. One morning I woke up with no pain at all — something that never happens — and I could feel the presence of God over me. I started praising Him and thanking Him for being there for me and my family. I’ve felt Him give me the strength to take care of my husband, to clean my home, and to keep going when I thought I couldn’t.",
    "what are the biggest changes you ve seen in the world during your lifetime": "Children are less respectful and the world is more dangerous. When I was young, I could be a teenager without fear. Now parents fear their child might go to school or out for the evening and never come back. Fewer families have both a mom and dad at home. People have turned away from loving the Lord.",
    "how do you want people to remember you": "As a kind-hearted person who cared about others and had a good heart.",
    "what lessons about love have you learned over the years": "Love is strong and it doesn’t happen overnight — it grows. The love your dad and I had grew over time. We stayed together through hard times, and our love became strong because of it.",
    "what lessons about life have you learned that you hope i ll remember": "Be strong, trust in the Lord, and put God first — then your children. Be a good father the way you had a good father.",
    "what s one thing you ve never told me that you think i should know": "When I was in the hospital, I thought I might die. I prayed and asked the Lord not to take me because I needed to be here for my husband — no one else would have the patience to care for him the way I would. God healed me, and I thank Him for that every day.",
    "what advice would you give to young mothers today": "Teach your kids to be respectful and kind. Love them more than you love material things.",
    "how do you define happiness now": "I’m not sad, but I also can’t say I’ve truly been happy in a long time. I know happiness can’t come from other people — it has to come from the Lord and from doing things that make me happy, like crafting, cooking for my kids, and being with my family.",
    "is there anything you still hope to do or experience in life": "Yes, I hope to have a house where the whole family can gather. I’d like to travel — go on a cruise, visit Hawaii — and have a home where my grandbabies and great-grandbabies can play and we can all enjoy each other.",
    "if you could write a message for future generations of our family what would it say": "Build your life on love and understanding. Trust the Lord. Be true to yourself, your children, and others. Help people when you can, whether they’re family or not. Being a good person goes a long way.",
