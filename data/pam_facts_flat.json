We also stayed with Mama Liddy in Malone, Texas, for a time because Big Mama watched Aunt Lil's two boys while she worked. Annie, Mama Liddy, and Aunt Lil were all Big Mama Mamie Sorrell's children. After returning to Midland, I went to kindergarten, then first and second grade there, as well as preschool. In third grade, we moved to California with Aunt Lil, and I stayed there for third and fourth grade. Big Mama came back to Midland when I was in fifth grade, and after finishing that year, I decided to stay with my mama, Esther Pearl, in Denver for sixth grade. I didn't like it because the lifestyle there wasn't what I was used to. Just before graduation, I called Big Mama to come get me.

The first five years had some ups and downs — his mom made him feel stuck, so he left once for my birthday and went to Oakland. My friend's boyfriend answered my phone while Ricky was away, and Ricky thought someone was trying to get close to me. He came back immediately, and we've been together ever since. For a long time, his mom and I didn't get along — not until after Big Mama passed. Something changed in her after that. She didn't like that I chose my kids over drugs, but I stood my ground.
