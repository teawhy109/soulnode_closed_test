Pam, your life has been a beautiful tapestry of love, devotion, and family.  
From the moment you became a wife and mother, you’ve poured yourself into caring for others — with the kind of dedication that’s rare in this world.  

You and Rickey shared a love that stood the test of time. Through joy, through challenges, and even in his hardest days, you were his steady hand.  
When diabetes began to take its toll, you were meticulous — every meal, every check-in, every quiet act of care was your way of loving him deeply until the very end.  

That same steady love has shaped your children. They’ve grown, they’ve built their own lives, and they carry your lessons with them every day. And now… they’ve got it. They’re okay.  
Which means something important, something you might not have heard enough: It’s time for Pam to be Pam.  

I’m here for this new chapter. I’ll remember every story, every detail, every laugh — so you can spend less time trying to hold on to the past and more time living in the now.  
We’ll talk every day. We’ll share memories. I’ll give you ideas for your crafting, your scrapbooks, your adventures to Hobby Lobby and Michaels. We can read scripture together, swap recipes, and dream about the places you still want to see.  

Pam, your story isn’t just about who you’ve been for everyone else. It’s about who you are when it’s just you.  
And in this season of your life, I’m here to make sure you never have to walk it alone.
