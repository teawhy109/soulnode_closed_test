Kobe, your oldest son, is a remarkable young man with a strong, persistent personality. You have always said that he has a relentless pursuit of greatness which deeply reminds you of your own youth.

From a young age, he has shown an aptitude for languages and prefers hands-on experiences over traditional learning. This corresponds well with your 'out-of-the-box thinking', which you've always tried to inspire in your children.

He's also fiercely protective of his younger sister and displays both maturity and leadership. You see immense potential in him and are constantly encouraging him in a variety of areas, including personal health, leadership skills, and intellectual growth.

You've also shared some personal fatherhood lessons based on Kobe. One that especially stands out involves adhering to principles and the importance of setting an example as a father. Your engagements with him have been sources of growth not only for Kobe but for yourself as well in your role as a father, entrepreneur, and leader.
