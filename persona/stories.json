The food, the laughter, the warmth of the home—it all felt right. Rickey never left. That meal began a 51-year partnership defined by respect, stability, and love."

When Yasha was poisoned, Rickey and Uncle Junior dug a deep grave and buried him in Mama Lil’s backyard. The family said goodbye to a guardian who had been more than a dog."

Marlon “Mar-Rock” West, a 60s Crip, would pull up his pants and say, “Yes, Ms. Butler.” Tara West was one of her favorites, too. Both were tragically killed young. Their memory lives on in the way Pam speaks of them: with love, gravity, and gratitude."

It wasn’t just food; it was family, ritual, and the safe center of gravity for an entire neighborhood."
