I can't remember the street. I think it's some 801, East Texas. It was nice. And then we went to Denver with ain't lil. The mama moved to Denver, and we stayed with ain't lil for a while, and we came back to Midland, and then I started kindergarten. Well, actually, we stayed with Mama Liddy for a while in Malone, Texas. And who is ain't Lil Mama Liddy and Amy. Who are these people? My aunts and these are big mama Mamie Sorrell children. Okay, okay, okay, we stay with ain't literally in Malone Texas for a while, because Big Mama watched a little at least two boys while she worked. And we came back to Midland and stayed with Annie for a while, and I started kindergarten, and then I went to first grade and second grade in Midland. I also did preschool in Midland. Then we moved to California with Aunt lil when I was in the third grade, and I stayed there with ain't lil for third, fourth. And then Big Mama came back to Midland when I was in the fifth grade. I did fifth grade there, and then I wanted to go stay with my mama in Denver, so I went when I was in sixth grade. And what's her name, Esther pearl. Okay. Did she go by that? Yes, okay. And then I stayed there for a year, and I didn't like it, because I wasn't used to the lifestyle that my mama lived, because that wasn't a lifestyle that I was brought up in. So I called my grandmother just before graduation, I told her to come get me. Come get me now. Then mama came and got me, and we came back to to LA and I did the seventh, eighth I did the rest of my years in Los Angeles, till I got pregnant with Jade. Okay, okay."

      "answer": "What do you mean like if you sat there and you thought about some of the stories as a child, not necessarily a teenager, but as a child, what are some of your memories that. You have, like living in some things that stick out when you were living in like Midland and Los Angeles in the beginning years. Well, living with Big Mama, I can remember being around all my aunts, ain't Helen ain't lit Lee, Raina Amy and Big Mama's son, Ernest. They called him Big Brother. I didn't like him, because even as a little kid, he he was a a bully, and he used to pull my hair and, I mean, he used to pull it hard, and I didn't like him at all. I didn't want to be around him, you know, but that was Big Mama's only son, and he would come around, he was an alcoholic, and he would come around and and then when he get ready to leave, he would catch one of my ponytails and just yank it. And I didn't like him. And I can remember seeing all my cousins with their moms and dads, and I didn't have a mama and a daddy. My grandmother raised me. I can remember stories Big Mama telling me about my mama, how she became to raise me, that my mama gave me to some woman in a hotel, and Big Mama found out, and Big Mama wouldn't got me. I was still an infant, and she got me, and that the lady, Big Mama said, The lady told her that pearl gave me to her, and Big Mama said, no, she gave you nothing, and she took me, and Big Mama raised me. I can remember calling Big Mama Mama, and she would tell me, I'm not your mother, I'm your grandmother, but I'm raising you. And so big mama took care of me. She walked me to school because Amy's house lived around maybe two blocks away from where her house was, and Big Mama would walk me to school, and that's before we moved to California, and she would walk me, and she took good care of me. So I remember those and then coming to LA I remember coming to LA, and it was good, you know, and me and spooky became really close, like brother and sister, but I can remember that I don't care how much I tried to fit in, I never fit in with my my aunts. I knew they loved me, but not as their children, and that used to bother me. So I'd said when I was young that when I got grown, my kids would know their mother and father. Station. Okay,"
    },
    {
      "type": "qa",
      "question": "can you tell me your biological mother and father's name?",
      "answer": "My mom's name was Esther Pearl, uh, sorrows. My dad's name was Hugo Henderson. I never met him, never saw him. I remember speaking to him once over the phone when I was, oh, I had to be about seven or eight, and he said he was coming by to see me, and he didn't come. They said he was sick. So I don't know. I remember him sending me a porcelain doll. I cherish that doll. And big mama used to take care of a little girl, and she wanted to see my doll, and Big Mama said, let her hold it, and I let her hold her. And when her mama came through Andy's front door, she threw my dog down and broke my dog but I never got to meet my dad. So when I came out here, I had to be younger than that, because when I came out here, I was eight, and and Lil said she was going to take me to see my dad, and he stayed in joy, stayed there Bakersfield, and she's going to take me to see and we were going to go down and I finally get to meet my dad, and he died before we got to Go down there. So I never knew any of my brothers and sisters on my dad's side. Supposedly, I was the youngest on my dad's side and the oldest on my mother's side, because my mom was 2122 when she had me, and he was 54 he was in his 50s. So I never got to see him. So when he passed away, one of my sisters, Sandra, she came down, but she was, she was an adult. She was in her 20s, and she came down to visit me. And I was so proud, you know, I had a sister and and that was the first and the last time I ever saw her. So I don't know any. Anybody on my daddy's side? I don't even know what he looked like. They just told me I had his eyes and I had a picture of him, but it was so grainy and so spoiled, you couldn't tell. And it was him sitting in a like a restaurant, on a bar stool, and my mama standing next to him. But you really couldn't I couldn't see his face because the picture was old, so I don't know what he looks like. If he'd have walked up to me, I couldn't have said who he was, because I've never seen him and only talked to him once. I left California to come before I left Midland to come to California, and I was scared to be little because I came to California when I was eight. So who are your brothers and sisters on your mother's side, and what was your relationship like with them as a child, I didn't have a relationship with them because I didn't grow up with them, Richard, it was me. Richard Jr, RV, RB, they called him Junior. And then Gretchen, she was a twin, but her twin died at birth, and then Larry lanetta, me and Richard, for some reason, were close. All you know, we were real. When I stayed in Midland, we stayed in Denver that year with them. Me and Richard became really close. And my brothers too, my brothers and sisters too, we were close, but I didn't really know them, because I didn't grow up with them. So I don't know anything about them because I was with Big Mom. I didn't you know that one year I was there when I was in sixth grade, and then I went back when she went to Portland for the summer. I spent the summer with him, but I didn't know him. I really don't know them. Now, you know I got to you really see Gretchen and linetta when I had you guys, when they came down and spent the summer with me. But I didn't know them. RV came down and met you, and Jade is before I had Asia, and he came down and spent a couple of weeks with us, and we stayed on 82nd and Vermont, and then he went home, and he had epilepsy, and he had a seizure and died. So I, you know, and then Gretchen passed, so it's three of us left. Well, no four. So she had six kids, three boys, three girls. Okay, so now it's two boys, two girls."

A little I never knew what she did before she became a beautician, and then she became a beautician, and that's what she did. But uh, Big Mama was. Her mom was a slave, but big mama wasn't.

I didn't, I didn't go through it just like I told my sister lanetta, she was talking and I was like, Well, you don't understand what Richard went through. You weren't even born. Richard went through a lot with your mom. You know, he was molested. He told me how she would bring men to the house, and he'd have to hide up under the bed, and when they take their pants and stuff off, he'd have to go through their wallets and take their money. See, I didn't, I didn't go through that. Actually, me and Fuji thought we were rich. You know, we went to 59th Street School, and then we decided that we didn't go to want to go to 59th Street School, because only poor kids would went there. We wanted to go to 74th Street School, and yo took us out and put us in 74th Street schools. No Uncle Frank would bring money home, and we always had money. Me and Fuji had money. Uncle Frank gave us money. And if we were outside playing with other kids, me and he give me a spooky $5 and all the kids around us, he'd give them $1 so they they just thought, wow, I can remember one time spooky them was doing a lemonade stand, and me and Tony wanted to do it, but we didn't have no money. So we collected all this pop cans bottles, and we were taking around the Fourth Street liquor store to sell the bottles to get us money so we could start us a lemonade stand. And Uncle Frank saw us. He had a fit. Oh, What are y'all doing? So we're gonna sell these? No, y'all ain't selling nobody. He made us leave them bottles in that wagon on the street, and he gave us money to start a lemonade stand. I can remember spooky, getting sick, and he had the measles, then he had the mumps, and, uh, Uncle Frank and ain't lil told him whatever he wanted he could have. So he called me, said, Pam, I can have anything. What should we get? I was like, I don't know. He said, gotta think of something. And I said, a piano. And he told a little piano. We got a piano. I can remember, Uncle Frank asked me, what do we want? And I told him I wanted a new bike. And he brought us men's food to these bikes called, I forget the name them, but they were high class bikes. They were gold, and they were, oh, they were nice. And we got bikes so it was anything we wanted. We got so I didn't suffer. I don't know what my brothers and sisters went through, but they didn't. Their life wasn't like mine. You know, I can remember going to school and coming home and I'd have outfits already laid out on my bed. Big Mama done went shopping her and ain't little. And so I had a good childhood. I really did. My childhood was a little better than what I could do for my kids. You know, I couldn't give them the stuff that I was given because me and Dad went through a lot of things. You know, he had to start over several times, but we were just good parents, at least.

You didn't, you didn't hang out then when you and Jamie and Dean, y'all hung out together, but I didn't worry about y'all in gangs like I did Jay. I just all I could do was pray, and Jay kept me up on Monday night, by the grace of God that that he's he's still here, but no. I think the most challenging one was you got to be older, and you decided that you didn't want to live with me no more. And you went and moved with Tony. You went out there to Tony, and I was talking to Tony and and she said, Don't worry. He, he Alright, he, you his mama.

Come running home to mama? Yep, yep, Tony, say he's sick. I didn't took him to the emergency room. He's got strength, though. And she said he want to come home, but I told him I could take care of him. And he's like, No, go home to my mama. You came home and I took care of you. I remember your I think it was, I don't know if it was your first paycheck or your second you bought me a CD player. I still have that CD player. I can't remember if it was for my birthday, a Mother's Day. I think it was my birthday, and you bought it for me. I still have it. I still have the camera that you bought me. How did go ahead?

Now you have that fear that your child will go out and not come back, even the fear of going to school and not coming home. We didn't have that fear then how people stopped loving the Lord and living in the world with Satan, that that wasn't like it when I was a kid, there was more mamas and daddies when I came up than it is now. Very few have a mama and a daddy in a home. Very few. How do you want people to remember you as a kind hearted person that cares about people a good heart? Yeah,"

      "question": "what lessons about love Have you learned over the years?",
      "answer": "Love is strong and it don't happen overnight. It grows so the love that me and your dad had, it grew. It didn't just just, it didn't happen overnight. You know, we first got together, say it was love, but that was love and lust, but we stayed together to where it grew into a strong love. And a lot of people don't have that love. They they they're together today and divorced tomorrow. And we didn't do that. We stayed together no matter what. Times wasn't easy, but we had each other. What lessons about life have you learned that you hope I'll remember being strong and putting your trust in the Lord, knowing that he has you and that there is a lord, a living God, and being a good dad the way you had a good dad, no matter what happens that your children are first, God is first then your children. That's what I want my kids to remember, even when they become grandfathers. So what's one thing you've never told me that you think I should know? We believe he was squatting that and when he was in your home, he drank some refrigerator that milk was waste. A compound. I guess it would be when I was in the hospital and at one point, well, I haven't told anybody this. I thought I was going to die, yes, and I had to pray and ask the Lord not to take me, because I had to be here for my husband, because nobody was going to take care of him the way I would. They weren't going to have the patience with him the way I did. I mean, they'd have patience, but then they would get tired of it where I didn't. And I can remember going down for the last time. If that that bubble on the side of my aorta hadn't gone down, I was going to have to have open heart surgery. And it took me down. And when I went down, it was flat, and I just started praising the Lord and thanking him, because I know that was him. And I remember my nurse coming in, and she said, I heard you. I said, you heard me? She said, Yes, ma'am, I heard you. I said, Well, what she said, I heard you praising the Lord. I said, Yeah, because he's the one that healed me. And it's been flat ever since. Every year that I go, I gotta go on the 25th of this month to have it the CT scan to make sure it's flat and nothing. But in my doctor, he checks, I love doctor Chester. Thing. He make sure I don't have any blood clots anywhere anyway, and he's so pleased, because he said, most of my patients, if this would have happened, I'd have been operating by now. He said, But yours is, is? I said, it's, God. He said, I know. So I never told anybody. I think, I think the only person that knew I was feeling like that was Sheila and Debbie, cuz they came to the room that next day and prayed over me. And I was like, yeah. So yeah, I felt I didn't think I was going to be here, but I had to be here for my husband. I couldn't leave him. So I knew you guys would take care of him, but y'all had your own families. Y'all, y'all couldn't take care of him the way I would. So yeah, okay, what advice would you give to a young mother or young mothers today? I teach your kids to be respectful and kind and love them more than you love yourself and materialistic things, it's not being a mother. It's nice to have those. But if you're not teaching your child how to have respect and manners and to respect elders and other adults, then"

      "question": "what are you teaching young mothers?",
      "answer": "So you gotta love them more than going out buying them $200 shoes, that's not teaching them anything. How do you define happiness? Now? I I don't know, it's been a long time since I can actually say I've been happy. I mean, I'm not, I'm not sad, but I don't, also don't see happiness. You know I struggle, and I don't know what that is. I can't explain it, and I know you can't look for someone else to make you happy. So I've turned to the Lord, because he has to be my grace and joy. He's the only one. So I can't look for my kids to make me happy or my grandkids to make me happy. I have to look to Pam. And that's what I said I was going to start doing, is doing things that make Pam happy, like my September 22 my I can't even think of the word that I do, my crafting that makes me happy, and cooking for my kids and getting things for my grandkids and just loving them that makes me happy, being around my kids, that makes me happy, but I have to also realize that they have a life, and they have to live their life the way I live mine, because I got to live my life, and so I have to realize that my kids have to live their lives too. These are the last two questions, is there, is there anything you still hope to do or experience in life? Yes, I hope to have a house. I would like to travel a little. I would love to go on a cruise. I'd like to go to Hawaii. Most of all, I want a home where I can enjoy all my family, where you guys can come and kids can play, and we can just enjoy being with each other. I look at Sheila and her family, they enjoy being around each other. Debbie and her family, they enjoy being around each other. You know, they do things together. They have their holidays together. I would love that where I got all my grandbabies and great grandbaby, and we're enjoying each other and enjoying being with each other, not having to be with each other, but enjoy being with each other. That would be that would be awesome. Okay, last question, if you could write a message for future, future generations of our family, what would it say? I. Boom, build it on love and understanding. The Lord on yourself being true to yourself and your children and others, help others when you can, whether it's family or not, just being a good person, that goes a long way. Okay, I think I got everything I need."

She and her husband, Rickey Butler, raised their children—Jay, Ty, and Aja—with respect, pride, and quiet excellence. In Inglewood, Pam was the neighborhood mother: firm rules, soft hands, hot meals, and a spotless house filled with spider plants and laughter. She served as a community liaison at Worthington Elementary, took kids to TV tapings, and treated everyone’s child like her own. People knew: when Pam spoke, you listened—and felt loved."

She read the Bible daily, kept her nails done, and crafted animated slideshows in ProShow Producer, dreaming of a new computer to make more. Pam and her husband, Rickey, were a steady team for 51 years; when she cooked, he taste-tested, and when life got hard, they held the line together."

Through Rickey’s diabetes and dialysis, she showed up—every appointment, every night—until his passing on May 20, 2020. She keeps his memory near: turning his ties into aprons and blankets for grandkids, telling stories about fishing trips and jazz in the kitchen. Pam carries grief and grace together, still caring for Aja through lupus, and finding joy as “Nana” and great-grandmother to Naiyomi."
